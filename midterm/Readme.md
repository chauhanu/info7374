## 40 points were for data gathering. I do not see the script to download and store the data nor do I see any data stored.
## Try not to collect the data in the file that you are using to analyze.

* Good use of functions.
* Comments are helpful
* Analysis are good. Presentation of answers is good(Not the UI but as a CSV file).
* Data collection needs more effort. Save the data and read it to analyze. Try to avoid calling the API unless required since you have the limitations.


> Work on data collection and storage. 
> Heading in the output CSV
> Add more columns (that would provide more information) to output
